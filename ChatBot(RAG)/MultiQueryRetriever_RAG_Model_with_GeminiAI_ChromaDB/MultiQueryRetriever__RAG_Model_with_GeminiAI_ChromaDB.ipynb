At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.\\n\\nWe’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.\\n\\nWe’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster.\\n\\nWe’re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/State_union.txt'}, page_content='So what are we waiting for? Let’s get this done. And while you’re at it, confirm my nominees to the Federal Reserve, which plays a critical role in fighting inflation.\\n\\nMy plan will not only lower costs to give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit.\\n\\nThe previous Administration not only ballooned the deficit with tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations, it undermined the watchdogs whose job was to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted.\\n\\nBut in my administration, the watchdogs have been welcomed back.\\n\\nWe’re going after the criminals who stole billions in relief money meant for small businesses and millions of Americans.\\n\\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that the Justice Department will name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud.\\n\\nBy the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office.\\n\\nThe only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/State_union.txt'}, page_content='One was stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from “burn pits” that incinerated wastes of war—medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more.\\n\\nWhen they came home, many of the world’s fittest and best trained warriors were never the same.\\n\\nHeadaches. Numbness.

I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year.
